TLS artifacts must have user-facing descriptions on their in-cluster resources.
These descriptions must be in the style of API documentation and must include
1. Which connections a CA bundle can be used to verify.
2. What kind of certificates a signer will sign for.
3. Which names and IPs a serving certificate terminates.
4. Which subject (user and group) a client certificate is created for.
To create a description, set the "openshift.io/description" annotation to the markdown formatted string describing your TLS artifact.
