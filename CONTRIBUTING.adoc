The OpenShift architecture builds upon the flexibility and scalability of https://docker.com/[Docker] and https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes[Kubernetes] to deliver a powerful new https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ40GobvA1c[Platform-as-a-Service] system. This article explains how to set up a development environment and get involved with this latest version of OpenShift.  Kubernetes is included in this repo for ease of development, and the version we include is periodically updated.

To get started you can either:

* <<download-from-github>>

Or if you are interested in development, start with:

* <<openshift-development>>

And choose between:

* <<develop-locally-on-your-host>>
* <<develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant>>

== Download from GitHub

The OpenShift team periodically publishes binaries to Github on https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[the Releases page].  These are Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X 64bit binaries (note that Mac and Windows are client only). You'll need Docker installed on your local system (see https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation[the installation page] if you've never installed Docker before).

The tar file for each platform contains a single binary `openshift` which is the all-in-one OpenShift installation.

* Use `sudo openshift start` to launch the server.  Root access is required to create services due to the need to modify IPTables.  See issue: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/1859.
* Use `osc -h <server> ...` to connect to an OpenShift server
* Use `openshift help` to see more about the commands in the binary


== OpenShift Development

To get started, https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo[fork] the https://github.com/openshift/origin[origin repo]

=== Develop locally on your host

You can develop OpenShift 3 on Windows, Mac, or Linux, but you'll need Docker installed on Linux to actually launch containers.

* For OpenShift 3 development, install the http://golang.org/[Go] programming language
* To launch containers, install the https://docker.com/[Docker] platform

Here's how to get set up:

1. For Go, Git and optionally also Docker, follow the links below to get to installation information for these tools: +
** http://golang.org/doc/install[Installing Go]. You must install Go 1.4.
** http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Installing Git]
** https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation[Installing Docker]. NOTE: OpenShift now requires at least Docker 1.6. RPMs for CentOS 7 are not yet available in the default yum repositories. If you're running CentOS, please see the link:README.md#docker-16[README] for information on where to get Docker 1.6 RPMs for your platform.
2. Next, create a Go workspace directory: +
+
----
$ mkdir $HOME/goworkspace
----
3. In your `.bashrc` file or `.bash_profile` file, set a GOPATH and update your PATH: +
+
----
export GOPATH=$HOME/goworkspace
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
----
4. Open up a new terminal or source the changes in your current terminal.  Then clone this repo:

        $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
        $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
        $ git clone git://github.com/<forkid>/origin  # Replace <forkid> with the your github id
        $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/openshift/origin
        $ cd origin

5.  From here, you can follow https://github.com/openshift/origin/#start-developing[Start Developing] from the README.

=== Develop on virtual machine using Vagrant

To facilitate rapid development we've put together a Vagrantfile you can use to stand up a development environment.

1.  http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads[Install Vagrant]

2.  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Install VirtualBox] (Ex: `yum install VirtualBox`)

3.  Clone the project and change into the directory:

        $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
        $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
        $ git clone git://github.com/<forkid>/origin  # Replace <forkid> with the your github id
        $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/openshift/origin
        $ cd origin

4.  Bring up the VM:

        $ vagrant up

5.  SSH in:

        $ vagrant ssh

6.  Run a build:

        $ cd /data/src/github.com/openshift/origin
        $ make build

7.  Start an OpenShift all-in-one server (includes everything you need to try OpenShift)

        $ sudo systemctl start openshift

8.  On your host system, try browsing to: https://localhost:8443/console

9.  From here, you can follow https://github.com/openshift/origin/#start-developing[Start Developing] from the README.

TIP: To ensure you get the latest image.  First run `vagrant box remove fedora_inst` and `vagrant box remove fedora_deps`.

TIP: See https://github.com/openshift/vagrant-openshift for more advanced options

==== Ensure virtual box interfaces are not managed by Network Manager

If you are developing on a Linux host, then you need to ensure that Network Manager is ignoring the
virtual box interfaces, otherwise they cause issues with multi-vm networking.

Follow these steps to ensure that virtual box interfaces are unmanaged:

1. Check the status of Network Manager devices:

   $ nmcli d

2. If any devices whose name start with vboxnet* are not unmanaged, then they need to be added to
   NetworkManager configuration to be ignored.

   $ cat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

        [keyfile]
        unmanaged-devices=mac:0a:00:27:00:00:00;mac:0a:00:27:00:00:01;mac:0a:00:27:00:00:02

3. One can use the following command to help generate the configuration:

   $ ip link list | grep vboxnet  -A 1 | grep link/ether | awk '{print "mac:" $2}' |  paste -sd ";" -

4. Reload the Network Manager configuration:

    $ sudo nmcli con reload
