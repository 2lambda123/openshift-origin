This directory has tools to generate:

    .../testdata/router/grpc-interop.yaml.

The generated YAML contains copies of server.go and client.go from the
cluster directory. The gRPC interop tests require a client and server
that share a known protobuf implementation.

The files in the cluster directory are zipped up and added as a
configmap entry in the test setup. The source file are then unzipped
in an init container and compiled from source. Note: we use the go.mod
and go.sum files to ensure this is repeatable. Once compilation is
successful the server is started and listens for both h2 and h2c gRPC
client connections.

The client-shell container should be used to invoke gRPC calls against
either the internal service or via external routes.
