[[faq]]
FAQ
~~~

1.  How does Origin relate to Kubernetes?
+
Origin is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for enterprise
application development and deployment, used by OpenShift 3 and Atomic
Enterprise. Origin embeds Kubernetes and adds additional functionality
to offer a simple, powerful, and easy-to-approach developer and operator
experience for building applications in containers. Our goal is to do
most of that work upstream, with integration and final packaging
occurring in Origin.
+
You can run the core Kubernetes server components with
`openshift start kube`, use `kubectl` via `openshift kube`, and the
Origin release zips include versions of `kubectl`, `kubelet`,
`kube-apiserver`, and other core components. You can see the version of
Kubernetes included with Origin via `openshift version`.

2.  How does Atomic Enterprise relate to Origin and OpenShift?
+
Two products are built from Origin, Atomic Enterprise and OpenShift.
Atomic Enterprise adds operational centric tools to enable easy
deployment and scaling and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and
large teams and applications. OpenShift provides a number of
developer-focused tools on top of Atomic Enterprise such as image
building, management, and enhanced deployment flows.

3.  What can I run on Origin?
+
Origin is designed to run any existing Docker images. In addition you
can define builds that will produce new Docker images from a Dockerfile.
However the real magic of Origin can be seen when using
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-To-Image] builds
which allow you to simply supply an application source repository which
will be combined with an existing Source-To-Image enabled Docker image
to produce a new runnable image that runs your application. We are
continuing to grow the ecosystem of Source-To-Image enabled images and
documenting them
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/overview.html[here].
Our available images are:
+
    * https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby[Ruby]
    * https://github.com/openshift/sti-python[Python]
    * https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs[NodeJS]
    * https://github.com/openshift/sti-php[PHP]
    * https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl[Perl]
    * https://github.com/openshift/wildfly-8-centos[Wildfly]
+
Your application image can be easily extended with a database service
with our
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/db_images/overview.html[database
images]. Our available database images are:
+
    * https://github.com/openshift/mysql[MySQL]
    * https://github.com/openshift/mongodb[MongoDB]
    * https://github.com/openshift/postgresql[PostgreSQL]

4.  Why doesn't my Docker image run on OpenShift?
+
Security! Origin runs with the following security policy by default:
+
    * Containers run as a non-root unique user that is separate from other
    system users
    ** They cannot access host resources, run privileged, or become root
    ** They are given CPU and memory limits defined by the system
    administrator
    ** Any persistent storage they access will be under a unique SELinux
    label, which prevents others from seeing their content
    ** These settings are per project, so containers in different projects
    cannot see each other by default
    * Regular users can run Docker, source, and custom builds
    ** By default, Docker builds can (and often do) run as root. You can
    control who can create Docker builds through the `builds/docker` and
    `builds/custom` policy resource.
    * Regular users and project admins cannot change their security quotas.
+
Many Docker containers expect to run as root (and therefore edit all the
contents of the filesystem). The
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/guidelines.html#openshift-specific-guidelines[Image
Author's guide] gives recommendations on making your image more secure
by default:
+
    * Don't run as root
    * Make directories you want to write to group-writable and owned by
    group id 0
    * Set the net-bind capability on your executables if they need to bind
    to ports <1024
+
Otherwise, you can see the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/manage_scc.html[security
documentation] for descriptions on how to relax these restrictions.

5.  How do I get networking working?
+
The Origin and Kubernetes network model assigns each pod (group of
containers) an IP that is expected to be reachable from all nodes in the
cluster. The default setup is through a simple SDN plugin with OVS -
this plugin expects the port 4679 to be open between nodes in the
cluster. Also, the Origin master processes need to be able to reach pods
via the network, so they may require the SDN plugin.
+
Other networking options are available such as Calico, Flannel, Nuage,
and Weave. For a non-overlay networking solution, existing networks can
be used by assigning a different subnet to each host, and ensuring
routing rules deliver packets bound for that subnet to the host it
belongs to. This is called
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/native_container_routing.html[host
subnet routing].

6.  Why can't I run Origin in a Docker image on boot2docker or Ubuntu?
+
Versions of Docker distributed by the Docker team don't allow containers
to mount volumes on the host and write to them (mount propagation is
private). Kubernetes manages volumes and uses them to expose secrets
into containers, which Origin uses to give containers the tokens they
need to access the API and run deployments and builds. Until mount
propagation is configurable in Docker you must use Docker on Fedora,
CentOS, or RHEL (which have a patch to allow mount propagation) or run
Origin outside of a container. Tracked in
https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/3072[this issue].

~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can develop
link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-locally-on-your-host[locally on your
host] or with a
link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[virtual
machine], or if you want to just try out Origin
link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc#download-from-github[download the latest Linux
server, or Windows and Mac OS X client pre-built binaries].

First, *get up and running with the*
link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[*Contributing Guide*].

All contributions are welcome - Origin uses the Apache 2 license and
does not require any contributor agreement to submit patches. Please
open issues for any bugs or problems you encounter, ask questions on the
OpenShift IRC channel (#openshift-dev on freenode), or get involved in
the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes[Kubernetes project] at the
container runtime layer.

See link:HACKING.adoc[HACKING.adoc] for more details on developing on
Origin including how different tests are setup.

If you want to run the test suite, make sure you have your environment
set up, and from the `origin` directory run:

-------------------------------------------
# run the unit tests
$ make check

# run a command-line integration test suite
$ hack/test-cmd.sh

# run the integration server test suite
$ hack/test-integration.sh

# run the end-to-end test suite
$ hack/test-end-to-end.sh

# run all of the tests above
$ make test
-------------------------------------------

You'll need https://github.com/coreos/etcd[etcd] installed and on your
path for the integration and end-to-end tests to run, and Docker must be
installed to run the end-to-end tests. To install etcd you should be
able to run:

----------------------
$ hack/install-etcd.sh
----------------------

Some of the components of Origin run as Docker images, including the
builders and deployment tools in `images/builder/docker/\*` and
`images/deploy/*`. To build them locally run

----------------------
$ hack/build-images.sh
----------------------

To hack on the web console, check out the assets/README.md file for
instructions on testing the console and building your changes.
