.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBoc adm certificate approve\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Approve a certificate signing request.

.PP
kubectl certificate approve allows a cluster admin to approve a certificate signing request (CSR). This action tells a certificate signing controller to issue a certificate to the requestor with the attributes requested in the CSR.

.PP
SECURITY NOTICE: Depending on the requested attributes, the issued certificate can potentially grant a requester access to cluster resources or to authenticate as a requested identity. Before approving a CSR, ensure you understand what the signed certificate can do.
