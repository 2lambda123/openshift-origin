.SH NAME
.PP
openshift kube completion \- Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift kube completion\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh). The shell code must be evalutated to provide interactive completion of kubectl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from the .bash \_profile.

.PP
Note: this requires the bash\-completion framework, which is not installed by default on Mac.  This can be installed by using homebrew:

.PP
$ brew install bash\-completion

.PP
Once installed, bash completion must be evaluated.  This can be done by adding the following line to the .bash profile

.PP
$ source $(brew \-\-prefix)/etc/bash\_completion

.PP
Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
