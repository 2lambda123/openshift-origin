.SH NAME
.PP
openshift kube drain \- Drain node in preparation for maintenance


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift kube drain\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Drain node in preparation for maintenance.

.PP
The given node will be marked unschedulable to prevent new pods from arriving. 'drain' evicts the pods if the APIServer supports eviction (
\[la]http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/\[ra]). Otherwise, it will use normal DELETE to delete the pods. The 'drain' evicts or deletes all pods except mirror pods (which cannot be deleted through the API server).  If there are DaemonSet\-managed pods, drain will not proceed without \-\-ignore\-daemonsets, and regardless it will not delete any DaemonSet\-managed pods, because those pods would be immediately replaced by the DaemonSet controller, which ignores unschedulable markings.  If there are any pods that are neither mirror pods nor managed by ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet or Job, then drain will not delete any pods unless you use \-\-force.  \-\-force will also allow deletion to proceed if the managing resource of one or more pods is missing.

.PP
'drain' waits for graceful termination. You should not operate on the machine until the command completes.

.PP
When you are ready to put the node back into service, use kubectl uncordon, which will make the node schedulable again.
