.SH NAME
.PP
openshift kube config \- Modify kubeconfig files


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift kube config\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Modify kubeconfig files using subcommands like "kubectl config set current\-context my\-context"

.PP
The loading order follows these rules:
.IP \(bu 2

.IP
\(bu If the \-\-kubeconfig flag is set, then only that file is loaded.  The flag may only be set once and no merging takes place.
.br
.IP
\(bu If $KUBECONFIG environment variable is set, then it is used a list of paths (normal path delimitting rules for your system).  These paths are merged.  When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza.  When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists.  If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.
.br
.IP
\(bu Otherwise, ${HOME}/.kube/config is used and no merging takes place.
