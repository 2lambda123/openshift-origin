A BuildSource is an object describing the SCM used for the <<v1.Build>>. A BuildSource contains a type string which defines the type of SCM used for the build. Currently, the only SCM supported by OpenShift is Git. As such, the BuildSource contains a <<v1.GitBuildSource>> to hold optional additional information about the Git build source. The contextDir in the BuildSource can specify a sub-directory in the SCM repository to use for the build. This allows to have buildable sources in directory other than root of a repository. The BuildSource also contains the source `Secret` that should be used for setting up the authentication for cloning a private repository. The secret must contain a data key with the name of the authentication method to use and the credentials in base64 encoded form in the value. Currently, OpenShift only supports `ssh-privatekey` as an authentication method.
