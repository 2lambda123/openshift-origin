A build is the process of transforming source code into a resulting set of artifacts. Typically, the resulting artifacts are runnable Docker images. The OpenShift build system provides support for three build strategies: link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#docker-build[Docker build], link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) Build], and link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#custom-build[Custom Build]. A Build encapsulates the inputs needed to produce a new deployable image as a <<v1.BuildSpec>>, as well as the status of the execution and a reference to the Pod which executed the build as a <<v1.BuildStatus>>.
