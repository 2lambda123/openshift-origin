NetNamespace represents a virtual resource backed by namespace. With openshift-sdn's multitenant plugin, NetNamespace holds the network ID for the project that ensures network layer isolation of traffic from other projects in the cluster. This resource is maintained to support backward compatibility with old openshift clients. Currently, NetNamespace information is stored as annotation on corresponding namespace.
