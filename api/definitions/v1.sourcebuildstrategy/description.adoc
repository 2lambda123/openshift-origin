A SourceBuildStrategy defines input parameters specific to a source-to-image <<v1.BuildStrategy>>. The SourceBuildStrategy contains a reference to an DockerImage, <<v1.ImageStream>>, <<v1.ImageStreamTag>>, or <<v1.ImageStreamImage>> from which the docker image should be pulled. The SourceBuildStrategy also contains a pull secret that should be used for setting up the authentication for pulling the Docker images from the private Docker registries. The SourceBuildStrategy also contains additional environment variables you want to pass into a builder container. The SourceBuildStrategy contains the location of scripts to be run in the container. The SourceBuildStrategy also contains a conditional variable that allows the <<v1.Build>> to do incremental builds. The SourceBuildStrategy also contains another conditional variable that determines if the builder should pull the images from the registry prior to building.
