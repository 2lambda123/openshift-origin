A BuildConfigSpec describes when and how builds are created. A BuildConfigSpec contains a list of triggers that determine how new <<v1.Build>>s can be launched from a <<v1.BuildConfig>>. If no triggers are defined, a new build can only occur as a result of an explicit client build creation. Triggers are represented as a <<v1.BuildTriggerPolicy>>. The BuildConfigSpec also contains a <<v1.BuildSpec>> that is the desired build specification.
