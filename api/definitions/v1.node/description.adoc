Nodes represent the machines that run the pods and containers in the cluster. A node resource is typically created and modified by the software running on the node - reporting information about capacity and the current health of the node. The labels of the node can be used by pods to specify a subset of the cluster to be scheduled on. The scheduler will only assign pods to nodes that have the `schedulable` condition set and also `ready`.
