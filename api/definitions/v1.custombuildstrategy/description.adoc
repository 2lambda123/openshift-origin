A CustomBuildStrategy defines input parameters specific to a custom <<v1.BuildStrategy>>. The CustomBuildStrategy contains a reference to an DockerImage, <<v1.ImageStream>>, <<v1.ImageStreamTag>>, or <<v1.ImageStreamImage>> from which the docker image should be pulled. The CustomBuildStrategy also contains a pull secret that should be used for setting up the authentication for pulling the Docker images from the private Docker registries. The CustomBuildStrategy also contains additional environment variables you want to pass into a builder container. The CustomBuildStrategy has a conditional variable that allows running Docker commands (and build Docker images) from inside the Docker container. In the future, cluster admins will be able to enforce 'false' for this option as it poses a security risk with untrusted code.
