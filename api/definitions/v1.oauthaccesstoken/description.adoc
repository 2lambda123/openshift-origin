An OAuthAccessToken is an object that holds the data required to fully define an access token. The OAuthAccessToken contains the name of the client that created the token, the expiration time of the token, the array of requested scopes, the redirection URI, user name, and unique user ID associated with the token, the token that authorized this token, and the (optional) value by which this token can be renewed.
