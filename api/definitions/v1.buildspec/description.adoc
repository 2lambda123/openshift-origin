A BuildSpec is a specification object that encapsulates all the inputs necessary to represent a build. The BuildSpec contains:
* The name of the service account as a string to use to run the build pod. The pod will be allowed to use secrets referenced by the <<v1.ServiceAccount>>.
* The SCM source in use as a <<v1.BuildSource>>.
* The (optional) revision information from the source repository used in the build as a <<v1.SourceRevision>>.
* The <<v1.BuildStrategy>> defining how to perform the build.
* The <<v1.BuildOutput>> describing the Docker image the build should produce.
* The compute resource requirements to execute the build.
