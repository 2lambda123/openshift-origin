A RoleBinding references a <<v1.Role>>, but does not contain it. The RoleBinding can reference any <<v1.Role>> in the same <<v1.Namespace> or in the global namespace. A RoleBinding groups the <<v1.Role>> it contains with the usernames of all <<v1.User>>s  and names of all <<v1.Group>>s that are directly bound it it. RoleBindings in a given namespace only have effect in that namespace. RoleBindings created in the master namespace have power in all namespaces.
