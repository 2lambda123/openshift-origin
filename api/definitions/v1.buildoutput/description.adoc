A BuildOutput is an optional input to a <<v1.BuildStrategy>> and specifies the output location of a build as a reference that can be resolved to a Docker repository where the resulting build image should be pushed. The output types supported are <<v1.ImageStreamTag>> and `DockerImage`. If `DockerImage` is specified, the Name of the reference should contain a Docker repository spec. In the case of an `ImageStreamTag`. the `ImageStreamTag` will be looked for in the namespace of the build unless another namespace is specified. The BuildOutput contains a <<v1.PushSecret>>that is the name of the <<v1.Secret>> that should be used for setting up the authentication for executing the Docker push to an authentication-enabled Docker Registry (or Docker Hub).
