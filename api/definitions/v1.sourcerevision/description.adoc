A SourceRevision is the revision or commit information information from the source repository used in the build. For instance, this could be the commit identifier for a Git-based build source. The SourceRevision contains a string that defines the type of <<v1.BuildSource>> it is used with. Currently the only type of BuildSource supported is Git. The SourceRevision contains the information about the revision in a <<v1.GitSourceRevision>>.
