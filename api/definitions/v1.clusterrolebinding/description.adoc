A ClusterRoleBinding object references a <<v1.ClusterRole>>, but does not contain it. The ClusterRoleBinding can reference any ClusterRole in the same <<v1.Namespace>> or in the global namespace. The ClusterRoleBinding contains the list of all <<v1.User>> usernames and <<v1.Group>> names that are directly bound to it, as well as the reference to the ClusterRole. ClusterRoleBindings in a given namespace only have effect in that namespace. ClusterRoleBindings in the master namespace have power in all namespaces.
