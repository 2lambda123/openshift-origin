Scale is a subresource representing the current "scale" of certain objects, such as
ReplicationControllers and DeploymentConfigs.  It may be checked to determine the current
replica count of these objects, or updated to set the replica count of these objects.

In the case of ReplicationControllers, this directly reflects the scale the ReplicationController.
For DeploymentConfigs, it reflects the scale of the deployment(s), or, if none are present, the
scale of the DeploymentConfig's template.
