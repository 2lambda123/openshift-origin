A SubjectAccessReview is an object for requesting information about whether a user or group can perform an action. A SubjectAccessReview holds information about the <<v1.User>> and the action they are requesting to make. The SubjectAccessReview holds the verb (get, list, watch, create, update or delete), the resource type to be acted on, a reference to the specific object to be operated on, and the name of the resource if it is to be created or deleted, the (optional) username for the user making the request and the (optional) list of groups to which that user belongs. If neither the username or grouplist are populated, the current authenticated user is used by default.
