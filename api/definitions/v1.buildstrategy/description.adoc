A BuildStrategy contains the details of how to perform a build. There are three build strategies available: link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#docker-build[Docker build], link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) Build], and link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-architecture/chapter-3-core-concepts#custom-build[Custom Build]. The BuildStrategy holds a type defining which strategy it is, and either a <<v1.DockerBuildStrategy>>, <<v1.SourceBuildStrategy>>, or <<v1.CustomBuildStrategy>> holding the paramters for the strategy.
