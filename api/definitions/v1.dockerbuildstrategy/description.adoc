A DockerBuildStrategy defines input parameters specific to a Docker <<v1.BuildStrategy>>. The DockerBuildStrategy contains a reference to an DockerImage, <<v1.ImageStream>>, <<v1.ImageStreamTag>>, or <<v1.ImageStreamImage>> from which the docker image should be pulled. The DockerBuildStrategy also contains a pull secret that should be used for setting up the authentication for pulling the Docker images from the private Docker registries. The DockerBuildStrategy also has a conditional variable that allows the docker build to be executed with the `--no=cache=true` flag. The DockerBuildStrategy also contains another conditional variable that determines if the builder should pull the images from the registry prior to building.
