kube\-controller\-manager \-


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkube\-controller\-manager\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Kubernetes controller manager is a daemon that embeds
the core control loops shipped with Kubernetes. In applications of robotics and
automation, a control loop is a non\-terminating loop that regulates the state of
the system. In Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared
state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the
current state towards the desired state. Examples of controllers that ship with
Kubernetes today are the replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace
controller, and serviceaccounts controller.


.SH OPTIONS
