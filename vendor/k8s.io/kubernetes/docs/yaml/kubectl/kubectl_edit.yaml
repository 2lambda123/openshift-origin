synopsis: Edit a resource on the server
description: "Edit a resource from the default editor. \n\nThe edit command allows
  you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command line tools.
  It will open the editor defined by your KUBE _EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables,
  or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. You can edit multiple objects,
  although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts filenames as well
  as command line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved
  versions of resources. \n\nEditing is done with the API version used to fetch the
  resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version,
  and group. \n\nThe default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify \"-o json\".
  \n\nThe flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise
  the default for your operating system will be used. \n\nIn the event an error occurs
  while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied
  changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing
  the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes
  to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include
  the latest resource version."
options:
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files to use to edit the resource
- name: include-extended-apis
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, include definitions of new APIs via calls to the API server. [default true]
- name: include-uninitialized
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the kubectl command applies to uninitialized objects. If explicitly set to false, this flag overrides other flags that make the kubectl commands apply to uninitialized objects, e.g., "--all". Objects with empty metadata.initializers are regarded as initialized.
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  default_value: yaml
  usage: 'Output format. One of: yaml|json.'
- name: output-patch
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Output the patch if the resource is edited.
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: validate
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, use a schema to validate the input before sending it
- name: windows-line-endings
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Defaults to the line ending native to your platform.
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.

  default_value: /home/username/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority

- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user

  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Edit the service named 'docker-registry':\n  kubectl edit svc/docker-registry\n
  \ \n  # Use an alternative editor\n  KUBE_EDITOR=\"nano\" kubectl edit svc/docker-registry\n
  \ \n  # Edit the job 'myjob' in JSON using the v1 API format:\n  kubectl edit job.v1.batch/myjob
  -o json\n  \n  # Edit the deployment 'mydeployment' in YAML and save the modified
  config in its annotation:\n  kubectl edit deployment/mydeployment -o yaml --save-config"
