synopsis: Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin
description: "Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin. The resource
  name must be specified. This resource will be created if it doesn't exist yet. To
  use 'apply', always create the resource initially with either 'apply' or 'create
  --save-config'. \n\nJSON and YAML formats are accepted. \n\nAlpha Disclaimer: the
  --prune functionality is not yet complete. Do not use unless you are aware of what
  the current state is. See https://issues.k8s.io/34274."

  usage: |
    When using the default or custom-column output format, don't print headers (default print headers).
- name: openapi-patch

    Output format. One of: json|yaml|wide|name|custom-columns=...|custom-columns-file=...|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=...

  usage: |
    Automatically resolve conflicts between the modified and live configuration by using values from the modified configuration
- name: prune

  usage: |
    Overwrite the default whitelist with <group/version/kind> for --prune
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.

- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    Only relevant during a force apply. The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete of the old resource, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).

  -f -\n  \n  # Note: --prune is still in Alpha\n  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml
  that matches label app=nginx and delete all the other resources that are not in
  the file and match label app=nginx.\n  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml -l
  app=nginx\n  \n  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml and delete all the other
  configmaps that are not in the file.\n  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml --all
