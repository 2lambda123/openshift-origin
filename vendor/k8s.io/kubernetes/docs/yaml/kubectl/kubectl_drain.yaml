synopsis: Drain node in preparation for maintenance
description: "Drain node in preparation for maintenance. \n\nThe given node will be
  marked unschedulable to prevent new pods from arriving. 'drain' evicts the pods
  if the APIServer supports eviction (http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/).
  Otherwise, it will use normal DELETE to delete the pods. The 'drain' evicts or deletes
  all pods except mirror pods (which cannot be deleted through the API server).  If
  there are DaemonSet-managed pods, drain will not proceed without --ignore-daemonsets,
  and regardless it will not delete any DaemonSet-managed pods, because those pods
  would be immediately replaced by the DaemonSet controller, which ignores unschedulable
  markings.  If there are any pods that are neither mirror pods nor managed by ReplicationController,
  ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet or Job, then drain will not delete any pods unless
  you use --force.  --force will also allow deletion to proceed if the managing resource
  of one or more pods is missing. \n\n'drain' waits for graceful termination. You
  should not operate on the machine until the command completes. \n\nWhen you are
  ready to put the node back into service, use kubectl uncordon, which will make the
  node schedulable again. \n\n! http://kubernetes.io/images/docs/kubectl_drain.svg"
options:
- name: delete-local-data
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Continue even if there are pods using emptyDir (local data that will be deleted when the node is drained).
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
- name: force
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Continue even if there are pods not managed by a ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet.
- name: grace-period
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Period of time in seconds given to each pod to terminate gracefully. If negative, the default value specified in the pod will be used.
- name: ignore-daemonsets
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Ignore DaemonSet-managed pods.
- name: selector
  shorthand: l
  usage: Selector (label query) to filter on
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up, zero means infinite
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
- name: cache-dir
  default_value: /home/username/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Drain node \"foo\", even if there are pods not managed by a ReplicationController,
  ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet on it.\n  $ kubectl drain foo --force\n
  \ \n  # As above, but abort if there are pods not managed by a ReplicationController,
  ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet, and use a grace period of 15 minutes.\n
  \ $ kubectl drain foo --grace-period=900"
