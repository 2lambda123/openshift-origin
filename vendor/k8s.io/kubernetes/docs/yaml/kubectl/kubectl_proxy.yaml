name: proxy
synopsis: Run a proxy to the Kubernetes API server
description: |
  Creates a proxy server or application-level gateway between localhost and the Kubernetes API Server. It also allows serving static content over specified HTTP path. All incoming data enters through one port and gets forwarded to the remote kubernetes API Server port, except for the path matching the static content path.
options:
- name: accept-hosts
  default_value: ^localhost$,^127\.0\.0\.1$,^\[::1\]$
  usage: Regular expression for hosts that the proxy should accept.
- name: accept-paths
  default_value: ^.*
  usage: Regular expression for paths that the proxy should accept.
- name: address
  default_value: 127.0.0.1
  usage: The IP address on which to serve on.
- name: api-prefix
  default_value: /
  usage: Prefix to serve the proxied API under.
- name: disable-filter
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, disable request filtering in the proxy. This is dangerous, and can leave you vulnerable to XSRF attacks, when used with an accessible port.
- name: port
  shorthand: p
  default_value: "8001"
  usage: |
    The port on which to run the proxy. Set to 0 to pick a random port.
- name: reject-methods
  default_value: ^$
  usage: "Regular expression for HTTP methods that the proxy should reject (example
    --reject-methods='POST,PUT,PATCH'). \n"
- name: reject-paths
  default_value: ^/api/.*/pods/.*/exec,^/api/.*/pods/.*/attach
  usage: |
    Regular expression for paths that the proxy should reject. Paths specified here will be rejected even accepted by --accept-paths.
- name: unix-socket
  shorthand: u
  usage: Unix socket on which to run the proxy.
- name: www
  shorthand: w
  usage: |
    Also serve static files from the given directory under the specified prefix.
- name: www-prefix
  shorthand: P
  default_value: /static/
  usage: |
    Prefix to serve static files under, if static file directory is specified.
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
- name: cache-dir
  default_value: /home/username/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # To proxy all of the kubernetes api and nothing else, use:\n  \n  $ kubectl
  proxy --api-prefix=/\n  \n  # To proxy only part of the kubernetes api and also
  some static files:\n  \n  $ kubectl proxy --www=/my/files --www-prefix=/static/
  --api-prefix=/api/\n  \n  # The above lets you 'curl localhost:8001/api/v1/pods'.\n
  \ \n  # To proxy the entire kubernetes api at a different root, use:\n  \n  $ kubectl
  proxy --api-prefix=/custom/\n  \n  # The above lets you 'curl localhost:8001/custom/api/v1/pods'\n
  \ \n  # Run a proxy to kubernetes apiserver on port 8011, serving static content
  from ./local/www/\n  kubectl proxy --port=8011 --www=./local/www/\n  \n  # Run a
  proxy to kubernetes apiserver on an arbitrary local port.\n  # The chosen port for
  the server will be output to stdout.\n  kubectl proxy --port=0\n  \n  # Run a proxy
  to kubernetes apiserver, changing the api prefix to k8s-api\n  # This makes e.g.
  the pods api available at localhost:8001/k8s-api/v1/pods/\n  kubectl proxy --api-prefix=/k8s-api"
