behaviors:
- id: service/basic-create/selector
  description: When a Service resource is created with type "ClusterIP", "NodePort", or "LoadBalancer",
    and a selector is specified, an Endpoints object is generated based with the IPs of pods with
    label keys and values matching the selector.
- id: service/basic-create/no-selector
  description: When a Service resource is created and a no selector is specified, no changes are made
    to any corresponding Endpoints object.
- id: service/type/ClusterIP/empty
  description: When the Service type is specified as "ClusterIP" and the clusterIP
    field is empty, a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints is
    allocated.
- id: service/type/ClusterIP/static
  description: When the Service type is specified as "ClusterIP" and the clusterIP
    field is specified as an IP address in the cluster service range, and that IP is
    not already assigned to another service, that IP is be allocated as a cluster-internal
    IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
- id: service/type/ClusterIP/None
  description: When the Service type is specified as "ClusterIP" and the clusterIP
    field is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a
    set of endpoints rather than a stable IP.
- id: service/type/NodePort
  description: When the Service type is specified as "NodePort" , a cluster-internal
    IP address for load-balancing to endpoints is allocated as for type "ClusterIP".
    Additionally, a cluster-wide port is allocated on every node, routing to the clusterIP.
- id: service/type/ExternalName
  description: When the Service type is specified as "ExternalName", the cluster DNS provider
    publishes a CNAME pointing from the service to the specified external name.
