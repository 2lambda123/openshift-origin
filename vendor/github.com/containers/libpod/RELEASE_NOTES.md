# Release Notes

## 0.8.5
### Features
- Added the ability to add a multipart entrypoint with `podman run --entrypoint`
- Improved help text when invalid commands are specified
- Greatly improved support for containers which use systemd as init

### Bugfixes
- Fixed several bugs with rootless `podman exec`
- Fixed rootless `podman` with a symlinked storage directory crashing
- Fixed bug with `podman ps` and multiple filters where the interface did not match Docker
- Fixed handling of `resolv.conf` on the host to handle symlinks
- Increased open file descriptor and process limits to match Docker and Buildah
- Fixed `podman run -h` to specify the container's hostname (as it does in Docker) instead of printing help text
- Fixed a bug with image shortname handling where repositories were incorrectly being treated as registries
- Fixed a bug where `podman wait` was busywaiting and consuming large amounts of CPU

## 0.8.4
### Features
- Added the `podman pod top` command
- Added the ability to easily share namespaces within a pod
- Added a pod statistics endpoint to the Varlink API
- Added information on container capabilities to the output of `podman inspect`

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug with the --device flag in `podman run` and `podman create`
- Fixed `podman pod stats` to accept partial pod IDs and pod names
- Fixed a bug with OCI hooks handling `ALWAYS` matches
- Fixed a bug with privileged rootless containers with `--net=host` set
- Fixed a bug where `podman exec --user` would not work with usernames, only numeric IDs
- Fixed a bug where Podman was forwarding both TCP and UDP ports to containers when protocol was not specified
- Fixed issues with Apparmor in rootless containers
- Fixed an issue with database encoding causing some containers created by Podman versions 0.8.1 and below to be unusable.

### Compatability:
We switched JSON encoding/decoding to a new library for this release to address a compatability issue introduced by v0.8.2.
However, this may cause issues with containers created in 0.8.2 and 0.8.3 with custom DNS servers.
