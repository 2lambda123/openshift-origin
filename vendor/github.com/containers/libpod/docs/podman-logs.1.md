## NAME
podman\-logs - Fetch the logs of a container

## SYNOPSIS
**podman** **logs** [*options*] *container*

## DESCRIPTION
The podman logs command batch-retrieves whatever logs are present for a container at the time of execution.
This does not guarantee execution order when combined with podman run (i.e. your run may not have generated
any logs at the time you execute podman logs

## OPTIONS

**--follow, -f**

Follow log output.  Default is false

**--since=TIMESTAMP**

Show logs since TIMESTAMP. The --since option can be Unix timestamps, date formatted timestamps, or Go duration
strings (e.g. 10m, 1h30m) computed relative to the client machine's time. Supported formats for date formatted
time stamps include RFC3339Nano, RFC3339, 2006-01-02T15:04:05, 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999, 2006-01-02Z07:00,
and 2006-01-02.

**--tail=LINES**

Output the specified number of LINES at the end of the logs.  LINES must be a positive integer.  Defaults to 0,
which prints all lines

**--timestamps, -t**

Show timestamps in the log outputs.  The default is false
