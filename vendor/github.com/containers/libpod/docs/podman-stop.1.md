% podman-stop "1"

## NAME
podman\-stop - Stop one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman stop** [*options*] *container* ...

## DESCRIPTION
Stops one or more containers.  You may use container IDs or names as input. The **--timeout** switch
allows you to specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly stopping the container after the stop command
is issued to the container. The default is 10 seconds. By default, containers are stopped with SIGTERM
and then SIGKILL after the timeout. The SIGTERM default can be overridden by the image used to create the
container and also via command line when creating the container.

## OPTIONS

**--timeout, --time, t**

Timeout to wait before forcibly stopping the container

**--all, -a**

Stop all running containers.  This does not include paused containers.

**--latest, -l**

Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last created container. If you use methods other than Podman
to run containers such as CRI-O, the last started container could be from either of those methods.

## EXAMPLE

podman stop mywebserver

podman stop 860a4b23

podman stop mywebserver 860a4b23

podman stop --timeout 2 860a4b23

podman stop -a

podman stop --latest
