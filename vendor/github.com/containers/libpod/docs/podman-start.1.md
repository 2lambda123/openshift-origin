% podman-start(1)

## NAME
podman\-start - Start one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman start** [*options*] *container* ...

## DESCRIPTION
Start one or more containers.  You may use container IDs or names as input.  The *attach* and *interactive*
options cannot be used to override the *--tty** and *--interactive* options from when the container
was created. If you attempt to start a running container with the *--attach* option, podman will simply
attach to the container.

## OPTIONS

**--attach, -a**

Attach container's STDOUT and STDERR.  The default is false. This option cannot be used when
starting multiple containers.

**--detach-keys**

Override the key sequence for detaching a container. Format is a single character [a-Z] or
ctrl-<value> where <value> is one of: a-z, @, ^, [, , or _.

**--interactive, -i**

Attach container's STDIN. The default is false.

**--latest, -l**

Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last created container. If you use methods other than Podman
to run containers such as CRI-O, the last started container could be from either of those methods.

**--sig-proxy**=*true*|*false*

Proxy received signals to the process (non-TTY mode only). SIGCHLD, SIGSTOP, and SIGKILL are not proxied. The default is false.

## EXAMPLE

podman start mywebserver

podman start 860a4b23 5421ab4

podman start -i -a 860a4b23

podman start -i -l
