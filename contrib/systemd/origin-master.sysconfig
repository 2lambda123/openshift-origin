# Proxy configuration
# Origin uses standard HTTP_PROXY environment variables. If your environment
# doesn't require a proxy between master, etcd, and node hosts please add them
# to NO_PROXY individually or using a wildcard like ".hosts.openshift.com"
#NO_PROXY=master.example.com
#HTTP_PROXY=http://USER:PASSWORD@IPADDR:PORT
#HTTPS_PROXY=https://USER:PASSWORD@IPADDR:PORT
